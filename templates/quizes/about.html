                    Ebullient Securities specializes in Quantitative Proprietary Trading. We, along with our sister
                    concerns, have presence in multiple markets across global exchanges where we continuously engage in
                    finding a niche for ourselves in the ever-dynamic capital market. We strive to ascertain
                    quantitative factors that are relevant in the market through a disciplined and systematic approach.
                    These factors then meet unparalleled risk management techniques before finally going live in the
                    market. Through continuous and repeated efforts these strategies are then refined over time to
                    generate consistent alpha.
